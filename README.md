## 📙 About <a name = "about"></a>
Through the snake game, the player controls a long, thin creature,
resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, 
picking up food (red squares). Each time the snake eats a piece of 
food, its tail grows longer. Instead of losing when hitting the edges
of the playing area, each opposite borders of the plane are  interconnected;
for instance, if the snake reaches the far right direction of the border,
it comes out of the left direction **(as demonstrated in the demo**) Therefore,
user only loses when the snake hits its own tail.

The user controls the direction of the snake through the following voice commands
***(please make sure mic permission is allowed through the browser when playing the game)***: 
* Up 
* Down 
* Right 
* Left

**PS**: a normal version of the game is also available that could be played
with normal keyboard arrows (up/down/right/left).
